# Project Notes

Started fresh on 2026-10-05. The old notes are in `archive/NOTES_old_2026-07_to_2026-10.md`. They are history only, not a working document. Only look in them for a specific detail, and check anything taken from them before relying on it.

This file is being filled in by going through the project together with the user, one topic at a time.

## Goal (agreed 2026-10-05)
- Estimate the total yearly cost of cybercrime incidents to UK businesses. Sole traders are left out because the survey doesn't include them.
- "Cybercrime" and "cost" mean whatever the survey asks about. We don't redefine them.
- The survey is the main input. The job is to scale it up to all UK businesses, bringing in supporting data only where needed (for example, how many businesses there are).
- We may reason informally from outside evidence or well-known cases (for example, to judge how big the largest losses can get), but we don't plan to bring in any major new data source.

## Data (agreed 2026-10-05)
- UK Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2025: 3,835 organisations, including charities and schools; we use the businesses. Survey weights scale the sample up to the business population. Files: `data/raw/data.sav`, `data/proc/data.csv`; codebook in `data/proc/csbs.txt`. UK business counts by size come from ONS (`data/external/`).
- Main questions used, all about the last 12 months:
  - which kinds of attack the firm had (a tick-list);
  - how often it was attacked (a band from "once" to "several times a day");
  - the cost of its single worst incident, as a band split into parts (staff time, payments, disruption, and so on);
  - for some attack types, counts of attempts and successes, what happened, and how long recovery took. Some questions went to only half the sample.
  - A total-cost-for-the-year question exists, but very few firms answered it.
- Main limits:
  - Only the worst incident is priced, not the year's total.
  - Costs come as bands, not exact figures.
  - There are few large firms and few big losses, and the top cost bands are nearly empty.
  - Answers are self-reported, and some firms skip the cost questions.
- Nobody has gone through all 527 columns by hand, so other useful columns may exist.
- User's view: the highest attack-frequency answers ("daily", "several times a day") are less trustworthy. This probably matters little, because those attacks are likely to cost almost nothing.

## Facts (being collected one at a time with the user)

### F1. Size, attack frequency and worst-incident cost (`src/estimation/core_vars.py`, 2026-10-05)
Note: `disrupta` is the TYPE of the worst breach, not its cost. The worst-incident cost is `damage_bands`.
Businesses only (questtype = 1). Shares below are weighted.
- **Being attacked rises with size.** The share attacked is 40% for Micro, 49% Small, 65% Medium and 68% Large.
- **Among attacked firms, how often they're attacked barely changes with size.** About 20% were attacked once, about 28% less than monthly, and about 5–8% several times a day, for every size band. Large firms have slightly more "several times a day" (14%, n = 129).
- **Worst-incident cost rises clearly with size.** "No cost" is 57% for Micro, 47% Small, 42% Medium and 35% Large. A cost of £5k or more is 2%, 6%, 8% and 21%.
- **Being attacked more often doesn't mean a costlier worst incident.** There's no upward trend across frequency bands, within Micro or within Small+. If anything, firms attacked only once are slightly less often at "no cost".
- **Reverse view:** Small+ firms with a worst incident of £5k–50k were more often attacked "once" or "less than monthly" (65%) than firms at "no cost" (42%). The samples are small.
- **Top of the range:** no business is above £500k. Eight are at £100k–500k (2 Micro, 2 Small, 1 Medium, 3 Large).

### F2. Crime types (`src/estimation/crime_types.py`, 2026-10-05)
Attacked businesses (n = 1,101). Shares are weighted. "Targeted" phishing = at least one phishing email containing the recipient's personal details (`phishcon_bands`). This is the survey's own measure of "specifically targeted".
- **How common:** phishing 85% of attacked firms, impersonation 35%, malware 18%. Ransomware, DoS, bank hacking and takeover are about 6–7% each. Outsider access, staff access, eavesdropping and other are each 4% or less. About half of phishing firms ticked nothing else.
- **Phishing counts:**
  - About half of phishing firms had at least one targeted email (answered by 822 of 957 phishing firms).
  - 14% had someone engage with a phishing email at least once. Engagement more than 3 times is almost never reported.
- **High attack frequency vs mass phishing (user's recollection not confirmed).**
  - Firms attacked daily or several times a day are no more often phishing-only than firms attacked monthly or weekly (about half in each).
  - They report MORE targeted phishing. 30–38% of them had 21 or more targeted emails, against 2–3% of firms attacked less than monthly.
  - Caveat: "contains personal details" may include mass emails that just insert the recipient's name, so the survey's "targeted" may partly be bulk mail.
  - Firms attacked only once are the least phishing-heavy (59% phishing, 49% impersonation).
- **Cost by the type of the worst incident** (`disrupta`; the share costing £5k or more is given in brackets):
  - mass phishing: 74% no cost (0%)
  - targeted phishing: 52% no cost (2%)
  - impersonation: 41% no cost (3%)
  - takeover: 35% no cost (3%)
  - DoS: 32% no cost (5%)
  - bank hacking: 27% no cost (10%)
  - malware: 38% no cost (12%)
  - ransomware: 3% no cost (41%)
  
  This matches the user's ordering: mass phishing < targeted phishing ≈ impersonation < the rarer types < ransomware.
- **Means by type are unreliable.** For impersonation, ransomware, DoS and bank hacking, a single firm (a £100k–500k incident) makes up 70–82% of the weighted mean. Without that firm, the means are about £1.3k, £8.8k, £1.4k and £2.1k.
- **Firms that ticked only one type are cheaper** than firms whose worst incident is that type. For example, impersonation-only firms are 62% no cost and 1% at £5k or more. Big costs come with several types ticked; to be looked at separately.

### F3. Which types occur together (`src/estimation/occurrence.py`, 2026-10-05)
Attacked businesses only. Shares are weighted.
- **One attack can tick several boxes (confirmed).** 40% of firms attacked "once" ticked 2 or more types, mostly phishing + impersonation (43 firms). Next come phishing + malware (8) and phishing + impersonation + bank hacking (5). The share ticking 2 or more is the same for "once" as for "less than monthly" or "monthly". It only rises for weekly or daily firms.
- **Phishing and impersonation are about independent of everything else.** Their co-occurrence with other types is about what chance predicts (ratio 0.8–1.2). Phishing and impersonation together are slightly below chance (0.86). This is partly because every attacked firm must tick something.
- **The rarer types go together.** Malware, ransomware, DoS, bank hacking, takeover, outsider access and staff access each co-occur with one another at about 2–4 times the rate chance predicts. This holds within Micro and within Small+ separately, so it isn't just a size effect. Outsider and staff access are especially tied (about 15 times chance, small n).
- **Firms are either narrow or broad.** Compared with independent types (same rates):
  - one type: 58% observed vs 41% expected
  - two or three types: 35% vs 56%
  - four or more: 7% vs 3%
- **Roughly one main pattern, with caveats.** Each rare type's rate climbs steeply with the number of other types ticked; for example, ransomware is 2%, 7% and 20% at 1, 2 and 3+ other types. A correlation breakdown gives one leading direction (all the rare types together, phishing excluded). It is not very dominant (eigenvalues 1.82, 1.23, 1.14), but that tool is weak for rare yes/no flags. The second direction is just phishing vs impersonation (an artefact of looking only at attacked firms). The third is the small unauthorised-access cluster (outsider + staff) against malware/ransomware.
- Open: whether the "broad" firms are firms exposed to more kinds of attack, or one big incident ticking several boxes (old notes leaned towards the latter for costly firms). This is to be looked at with cost.
